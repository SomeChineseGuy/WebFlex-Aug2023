# W02D01 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do

- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Testing

- Manual - everyone just running the code
- Unit test - testing the smallest piece of your code (functions)
- What did we actually get back from the function vs what we expected to get back

### NPM

### 3 ways to install packages

```bash
npm i/install mocha # Install as a dependency for our project
npm install --save-dev mocha # Install as a DEV dependency of our project
npm install --global mocha # Install into our OS
```
